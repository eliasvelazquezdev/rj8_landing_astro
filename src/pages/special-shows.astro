                Special Live Shows
            </h2>

            <p class="mb-5 md:w-2/3">These are some of the special live shows I performed on my YouTube channel in the last couple of years. You can find the rest of them on my channel under the Live tab section.</p>

            <p class="mb-5 md:w-2/3">I just selected the ones I like the most and that I think will be of your interest. I mean, if you're here reading these lines, it has to be for something, right?</p>

            <p class="mb-5 md:w-2/3">So, get ready to relax (or work, study, clean your house...well, you catch my drift) and press the play buttons. You're in for a treat ðŸ˜‰</p>

                specialDescription="My Halloween special for 2023. If you're into the 80's music in general, then you're gonna love it. It was a great chance for me to play non-Depeche Mode songs (tho I ended up playing a few DM songs at public request). A little bit of New Order here, some Erasure there, oh! , and even some Nine Inch Nails."

                specialTitle="Exotic Tour Instrumental - Second Show"
                specialDescription="As the title says, this is the second performance of my homage to Depeche Mode's Exotic Tour. I like the setlist for this one a little bit better than the first live special. More than 2 hours of pure devotion. Do you have your candles at hand?"
