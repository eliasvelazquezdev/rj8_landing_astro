                Special Live Shows
            </h2>

            <p class="mb-5 md:w-2/3">These are some of the special live shows I performed on my YouTube channel in the last couple of years. You can find the rest of them on my channel under the Live tab section.</p>

            <p class="mb-5 md:w-2/3">I just selected the ones I like the most and that I think will be of your interest. I mean, if you're here reading these lines, it has to be for something, right?</p>

            <p class="mb-5 md:w-2/3">So, get ready to relax (or work, study, clean your house...well, you catch my drift) and press the play buttons. You're in for a treat ðŸ˜‰</p>

                specialTitle="RJ8's Spooky Show"
                specialDescription="My Halloween special for 2023. If you're into the 80's music in general, then you're gonna love it. It was a great chance for me to play non-Depeche Mode songs (tho I ended up playing a few DM songs at public request). A little bit of New Order here, some Erasure there, oh! , and even some Nine Inch Nails."

                specialTitle="Exotic Tour Instrumental - Second Show"
                specialDescription="As the title says, this is the second performance of my homage to Depeche Mode's Exotic Tour. I like the setlist for this one a little bit better than the first live special. More than 2 hours of pure devotion. Do you have your candles at hand?"

                specialTitle="101 - 35th Anniversary"
                specialDescription="Grab your mic, it's time to sing! Imagine yourself there on stage with your friends on the keyboards. The iconic and legendary 101th concert of the Tour For The Masses is about to start! And yes, I streamed this on a June 18th."

                specialTitle="Pet Shop Boys Anthology"
                specialDescription="If you consider yourself a pethead or if you just like some PSB songs, you're gonna enjoy this. I play some of their most famous hits and some other songs (even B sides) that are part of my PSB favorites of all times."

                specialTitle="Andrew Fletcher - In Your Memory"
                specialDescription="I never thought I'd do a show like this one. You know, we humans refuse to believe that our heroes can and will die some day. But, memento mori. The important thing on this live event is that I show every single part Fletch played live on his keyboards for some of Depeche Mode's tours. Yes, he played things besides jumping and eating bananas on stage and I can prove it."
