                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">¬øWhat's the Black Celebration tour project?</h3>
                <p class="mb-10">The "Black Celebration Tour - A fans tribute" is a fan project that recreates the iconic Black Celebration gig performed by Depeche Mode at Wembley Arena, London, on April 16th, 1986. The goal is that you feel you're listening to an official and high quality live recording of that night.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">So, it's not Depeche Mode then.</h3>
                <p class="mb-10">No, you're not listening to any audience or soundboard recording. Everything was recreated from scratch. Original samples were used to recreate most of the synth lines, melodies and backing tracks.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">¬øWere the vocals extracted/isolated from a sounboard?</h3>
                <p class="mb-10">Believe it or not, the vocals you hear on every recording related to this project were recorded by the same singer that lend his artistic skills to the World Violation Tour - A fans tribute: Claudio Blanco. No, it's not Dave.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">¬øIs there a video version of this?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">The premiere of this project was broadcasted on April 23th and a replay had place on May 14th, 2023, both on my YouTube channel. Unfortunately, both performances got blocked due to copyright issues.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">If you're interested in a video version of the whole concert, please let me know through the homepage contact form.</p>
