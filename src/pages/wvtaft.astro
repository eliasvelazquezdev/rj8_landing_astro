                    Background
                </h2>
                <div class="lg:w-2/3">
                    <p class="mb-3">As a dedicated Depeche Mode fan (having spent half my life listening to their music), I have often pondered why the tour that supported what many consider to be the band's best album, <em>Violator</em>, still lacks an official recording or DVD release. Why on Earth is that? This question remains unanswered and as time goes by there is no indication that an official release of the World Violation Tour will ever materialize.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">With that nagging question haunting me through the years, I realized that fans deserved something better than the soundboard recordings currently available. With my skills and connections, I decided to take a chance and bring my idea to life. I shared my plan with some friends and in August 2021, I began working on the project. After seven months of hard work, the <strong>World Violation Tour Remastered</strong> was born and released on March 20th, 2022.</p>
                
                    <p class="mb-3">During a live broadcast on YouTube, I shared the project with my community and the response was overwhelming. Despite some negative critics, which are to be expected, many fans were captivated and amazed by it. Some even believed that they were listening to a real Depeche Mode performance from some concert recording.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">After those events and after releasing the <a href="/bctaft/" class="underline underline-offset-8" target="_blank">Black Celebration Tour - A fans tribute</a> project, I decided I could do better. I gathered my crew once again for advice and some help. We got to work together (a new member was added to the team) and voila! The magic happened again.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">With a better mix and even new sounds, we achieved our goal. Our biggest project ever released got a new life under a new name: <em>World Violation Tour - A fans tribute</em>.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">I want to thank all of the fans who supported this project from the beginning or gave it a chance. Your support made this project possible. If you're intrigued by it, consider <a href="https://rj8covers.gumroad.com/l/wvtaft" class="underline underline-offset-8" target="_blank">getting a copy</a> to support the creators.</p>

However, some may have wondered whether we had extracted the vocals from the soundboards available on the internet. But why settle for second best when we could do it the old-fashioned way? Instead, we opted to take a more authentic approach, enlisting the talents of an exceptional singer to record the vocals for the project.</p> <p class=' mb-3'>Enter Claudio Blanco, one of the most gifted vocalists I have had the privilege of knowing. With remarkable skill and precision, he masterfully recreated the performances of Dave Gahan and Martin Gore, breathing new life into their legendary stage performances. Furthermore, Claudio's contribution extended beyond just the vocal tracks, as he also played a crucial role in emulating the sound of the crowd singing in some of the songs, lending an added layer of authenticity to the project.</p>"

                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">Â¿What's the World Violation Tour project exactly?</h3>
                <p class="mb-10">The "World Violation Tour - A fans tribute" is a fan project that recreates the iconic World Violation shows performed by Depeche Mode that took place at the Dodgers Stadium, Los Angeles, on August 4th and 5th, 1990. The goal is that you feel you're listening to an official and high quality live recording of that night.</p>
                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">So, it's not Depeche Mode then.</h3>
                <p class="mb-10">No, you're not listening to any audience or soundboard recording. Everything was recreated from scratch. Original samples were used to recreate most of the synth lines, melodies and backing tracks.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">Â¿Were the vocals extracted/isolated from a sounboard?</h3>
                <p class="mb-10">Believe it or not, the vocals you hear on every recording related to this project were recorded by Claudio Blanco, aka @perihelion54 on YouTube. No, it's not Dave.</p>
                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">Â¿How's this different from the WVT Remastered project you released on 2021?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">The World Violation Tour Remastered was the original name of this project. Since it often led to confusion, I decided to rename the whole thing.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">But that's not the only difference. The overall sound of the project was improved, dramatically in some songs. Everything sounds sharper, louder and more dynamic than ever!</p>
                <h3 class="text-lg mb-3 font-light">Â¿Do I have to buy the digital release again if I bought the first version?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">Short answer: no. For those who supported the original project by getting a copy of the digital release, you'll get the new version for free! Just send me a receipt of your Gumroad purchase to my email. That way I know you bought the WVT Remastered release and I'll happily send the new one for free!</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Please have in mind that this doesn't apply if you just downloaded the first version when it had no cost.</p>
