                </h2>
                <div class="md:w-2/3">
                    <p class="mb-3">As a dedicated Depeche Mode fan (having spent half my life listening to their music), I have often pondered why the tour that supported what many consider to be the band's best album, <em>Violator</em>, still lacks an official recording or DVD release. Why on Earth is that? This question remains unanswered and as time goes by there is no indication that an official release of the World Violation Tour will ever materialize.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">With that nagging question haunting me through the years, I realized that fans deserved something better than the soundboard recordings currently available. With my skills and connections, I decided to take a chance and bring my idea to life. I shared my plan with some friends and in August 2021, I began working on the project. After seven months of hard work, the <strong>World Violation Tour Remastered</strong> was born and released on March 20th, 2022.</p>
                
                    <p class="mb-3">During a live broadcast on YouTube, I shared the project with my community and the response was overwhelming. Despite some negative critics, which are to be expected, many fans were captivated and amazed by it. Some even believed that they were listening to a real Depeche Mode performance from some concert recording.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">After those events and after releasing the <a href="/bctaft/" target="_blank"/>Black Celebration Tour - A fans tribute</a> project, I decided I could do better. I gathered my crew once again for advice and some help. We got to work together (a new member was added to the team) and voila! The magic happened again.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">With a better mix and even new sounds, we achieved our goal. Our biggest project ever released got a new life under a new name: <em>World Violation Tour - A fans tribute</em>.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">I want to thank all of the fans who supported this project from the beginning or gave it a chance. Your support made this project possible. If you're intrigued by it, consider <a href="https://rj8covers.gumroad.com/l/wvtaft" target="_blank" class="">getting a copy</a> to support the creators.</p>

However, some may have wondered whether we had extracted the vocals from the soundboards available on the internet. But why settle for second best when we could do it the old-fashioned way? Instead, we opted to take a more authentic approach, enlisting the talents of an exceptional singer to record the vocals for the project.</p> <p class='md:w-2/4 mb-3'>Enter Claudio Blanco, one of the most gifted vocalists I have had the privilege of knowing. With remarkable skill and precision, he masterfully recreated the performances of Dave Gahan and Martin Gore, breathing new life into their legendary stage performances. Furthermore, Claudio's contribution extended beyond just the vocal tracks, as he also played a crucial role in emulating the sound of the crowd singing in some of the songs, lending an added layer of authenticity to the project.</p>"
